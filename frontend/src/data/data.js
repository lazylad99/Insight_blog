        des: 'When we take photographs today especially on our phones we don‚Äôt consider them as historical documents. Photography is more ubiquitous than ever and for all likelihood our pictures will quietly rot away on a memory card or be deleted during routine maintenance in a dark corner of a nameless datacenter. Maybe they will become part of some AI as a minuscule fragment of the training set but never actually preserved. Besides who really thinks about mundane moments of life like a walk in the park with family as important in a historical context.'

        des: 'Here‚Äôs a challenge for you: Reflect on the places where you experienced life‚Äôs simplest pleasures. Do you imagine the scenic hike you took to get some steps in for the day? That park you took your kids to every Saturday morning? Or maybe even your own backyard? It‚Äôs impossible for me to imagine being in any of my favorite places without trees, but beyond my personal enjoyment, forests are so important because they are home to three-quarters of the planet‚Äôs life on land and provide clean air and water. Forests are simply the best nature-based solution to address the climate crisis, and we must do what we can to protect them.I‚Äôm fortunate to work at a company that understands the true value of forests both to its business and in the fight against climate change and knows the best way to make real impact is through partnership. HP Inc. and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have been working together for over a decade to ensure that we are sourcing our paper products responsibly. Partnerships like this have helped HP reach many environmental milestones. HP brand paper has been deforestation-free since 2016, and in 2020, HP achieved zero deforestation for 99% of HP paper-based product packaging with the remaining 1% assessed to ensure reported fiber usage meets HP‚Äôs Sustainable Paper and Wood Policy.'

        des: 'How often do you get a winning position, but then you‚Äôre unable to win it? When at the end of the game, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ I was so close to winning‚Ä¶‚Äù. Familiar feeling?üòä.Well, you‚Äôre not alone. Many players experience such unpleasant moments when they play a perfect game, get a winning position, and then don‚Äôt win it. The problem with winning positions is that they don‚Äôt get won on autopilot. YOU must be the pilot and take the won game to its final destination when the opponent resigns.'
